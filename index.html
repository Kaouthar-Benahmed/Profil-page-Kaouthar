        <h2>PNL ✨</h2>
        <img src="images/en-pensant.png" alt="PNL" class="img">
        <p>PNL, or Neuro-Linguistic Programming, has changed my life significantly🌟.
          I discovered NLP when I was going through a difficult period in my personal life💔.
          I was stressed, anxious and couldn't communicate effectively with others😨.
          I became interested in NLP 💡 after reading several books on the subject. 
          I was fascinated 🤯 by the tools and techniques offered by this approach, which allow to better understand one's own thinking and behaviour patterns, as well as those of others😇.

        <h2>CNV ✨</h2>
        <img src="images/groupe.png" alt="CNV" class="img">
        <p>I became interested in NVC after attending a training workshop on this communication approach.
          Then I started to practice NVC in my own life.
           I learned to communicate more respectfully, to listen 👂🏻 to others without judgement ❌ and to identify underlying needs in conflict situations.😇</p>

        <h2>Development personal ✨</h2>
        <img src="images/developpement-personnel.png" alt="Development personal" class="img">
        <p>Personal development has profoundly changed my life 🦋 by allowing me to discover my strengths, weaknesses, needs and deep aspirations 🌷.
          Through regular practices of meditation 🧘🏻‍♀️, visualisation, reflection and coaching 💪🏻, I have developed a better understanding of myself and others 🥰, and a clearer vision of what I want to achieve in my life🥇🚩.</p>
